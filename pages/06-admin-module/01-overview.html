    <h1>Admin Module Overview</h1>
    <p>
        The Admin Module is the central control panel for CareSyncOS. It is designed for users with the 'admin' role and
        provides the highest level of access to system configuration, user management, and operational oversight.
    </p>
    <p>
        From this module, administrators can manage branches, onboard new employees, set roles and permissions, monitor
        system-wide activity through audit logs, and manage financial data like expenses and budgets. It is the heart of
        the system's administrative functions.

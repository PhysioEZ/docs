# PhysioEZ Desktop Application

## **Overview**

**PhysioEZ Desktop** is the command center for your clinic. It is a native desktop application designed for high-performance, daily clinic management. Unlike a regular website, it runs directly on your computer, giving you faster access to patient data, hardware integration (like printers and scanners), and offline-capable features.

It serves two main types of users:

1.  **Receptionists**: For booking appointments, registering patients, and managing billing.
2.  **Admins**: For viewing reports, managing staff, and configuring system settings.

## **Why a Desktop App?**

We chose to build a downloadable desktop application instead of just a website for three key reasons:

- **Speed & Performance**: It launches instantly and handles heavy data without the lag often seen in web browsers.
- **System Integration**: It can talk directly to receipt printers, barcode scanners, and the local file system for backups.
- **Focus**: A dedicated app window removes browser distractions (tabs, bookmarks), providing a focused workspace for staff.

## **Key Features**

- **Unified Dashboard**: See today's appointments, collection totals, and critical alerts in one view.
- **Smart Patient Search**: Instantly find patients by name, phone, or ID with real-time results.
- **Offline First**: Continue working even if the internet connection is spotty (data syncs when back online).
- **Secure**: Patient data is encrypted and stored securely, meeting healthcare privacy standards.

## **Technology Stack (Simplified)**

Under the hood, PhysioEZ Desktop uses modern, reliable technologies trusted by companies like Microsoft and Spotify:

- **Tauri**: The "shell" that allows our web code to run as a lightweight native app on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
- **React**: The industry standard for building interactive user interfaces (used by Facebook).
- **Node.js**: The engine that handles the logic and database connections.
- **MySQL**: The database system that safely stores all patient records and transaction history.
